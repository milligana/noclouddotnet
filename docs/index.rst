Cloud-Init NoCloudDotNet Documentation
######################################

Cloud-init is the *industry standard* multi-distribution method for
cross-platform cloud instance initialization. It is supported across all
major public cloud providers, provisioning systems for private cloud
infrastructure, and bare-metal installations.

Cloud instances are initialized from a disk image and instance data:

- Cloud metadata
- User data (optional)
- Vendor data (optional)

NoCloudDotNet is a back-end for the `NoCloud Data Source <https://cloudinit.readthedocs.io/en/latest/topics/datasources/nocloud.html>`_.
